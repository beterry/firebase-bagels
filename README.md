# Reading and writing data from Firebase Firestore
A small project designed to experiment with reading and writing data from Firebase Firestore

[Finished experiment](https://beterry.github.io/firebase-bagels/)

## About this experiment

### What is Firebase?

Firebase is a suite of application development services provided by Google. These services include: 

- Cloud Firestore (NoSQL database)
- Authentication
- Hosting
- Cloud Storage
- Analytics
- And much moreâ€¦

Google describes these services as a cohesive platform which allows for developers to easily manage infrastructure and focus on building great user experiences. 

### Cloud Firestore

For this experiment, I was interested in learning about reading and writing data from Cloud Firestore. 

Firestore is a NoSQL database which supports real-time data fetching and an easy-to-use data browsing tool. NoSQL (non-relational) means that instead of organizing data into a table, data is organized in key-value pairs. NoSQL databases have no predefined structure so developers can organize data however is most efficient for the front-end application.

### Goals

1. Create a Firestore database
2. Link the database to a simple application
3. Read and display data from the Firestore
4. Save data to the Firestore
